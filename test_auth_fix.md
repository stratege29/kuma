# Authentication Fix Test Plan

## Issue Fixed
The app was staying in infinite loading state after successful user signup because:

1. User signs up successfully → AuthBloc emits `AuthState.authenticated(user)`
2. Firebase's `authStateChanges` stream fires due to new user creation
3. The listener triggers `checkAuthStatus()` after 500ms delay
4. This emits `AuthState.loading()` which overwrites the authenticated state
5. App gets stuck in loading state

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added a signup flag (`_isSigningUp`) to AuthBloc
- Prevents auth state listener from interfering during active authentication operations
- Guards both immediate and delayed auth checks

### 2. Updated authentication methods
- Set `_isSigningUp = true` at start of authentication
- Clear `_isSigningUp = false` on success, failure, or exception
- Applied to all authentication methods (Google, Apple, Email sign-in/up)

### 3. Enhanced auth state listener
- Check `_isSigningUp` flag before triggering auth status checks
- Double-check flag after delay to prevent race conditions

## Test Cases to Verify

### Manual Testing
1. **New User Signup Flow**:
   - Open app
   - Create new account with email/password
   - ✅ **Expected**: App should navigate to onboarding page after successful signup
   - ❌ **Previous**: App stayed in loading state infinitely

2. **Existing User Login Flow**:
   - Login with existing credentials
   - ✅ **Expected**: App should navigate appropriately based on onboarding status

3. **Social Authentication**:
   - Test Google Sign-In
   - Test Apple Sign-In (iOS only)
   - ✅ **Expected**: Both should work without infinite loading

### Debug Logs to Watch For
During signup, you should see this sequence:
```
AuthBloc: Starting sign-up with email/password...
AuthWrapper state change: AuthState.loading()
AuthRemoteDataSource: Getting user document for uid: [USER_ID]
AuthRemoteDataSource: User data saved successfully
AuthBloc: Sign-up result received: Right(AppUser(...))
AuthBloc: Sign-up successful, user: [USER_ID]
AuthWrapper state change: AuthState.authenticated(user: AppUser(...))
AuthWrapper: Authenticated with user: [USER_ID]
AuthWrapper: Device onboarding: false, country: ""
AuthWrapper: User onboarding: false, country: ""
AuthWrapper: Final decision - completed: false, hasCountry: false
AuthWrapper: No starting country selected, redirecting to onboarding
```

**Key**: The auth state listener should NOT trigger additional `checkAuthStatus()` calls that would emit loading state.

## Files Modified
- `/lib/features/auth/presentation/bloc/auth_bloc.dart`
  - Added `_isSigningUp` flag
  - Enhanced auth state listener guards
  - Updated all authentication methods

## Dependencies to Check
- Ensure `build_runner` generates updated freezed files
- Run `flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
- Check that all imports resolve correctly

## Success Criteria
✅ User signup completes and navigates to onboarding
✅ No infinite loading states
✅ Existing authentication flows remain unaffected
✅ No compilation or analysis errors
